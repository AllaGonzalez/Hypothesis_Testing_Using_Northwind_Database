    "Here's is the general structure of experimental design:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Make an observation**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Observe a phenomenon and formulate a question we want to test.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Examine the research**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Find out if there is an existing research that answers our question.\n",
    "* *For the purposes of this project, we are going to skip this step.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Form a hypothesis**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Formulate an Alternative Hypothesis (our educated guess to the test question) and a Null Hypothesis (the opposite to the Alternative Hypothesis).\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Conduct an experiment**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Account for mistakes and randomness and run a well-structured experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Analyze experimental results**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define if the outcomes of our experiment are statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Draw conclusions**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Based on the findings and analysis of our experiment, either reject the Null Hypothesis or fail to reject the Null Hypothesis.\n",
